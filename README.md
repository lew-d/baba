# Baba

---

Baba is a super simple shell which I built over the course of a few hours a couple of weeks ago as a way to learn more about how shells work.

It's not very useful, but I'm currently dogfooding it and it's been working well for me so far.

Right now, Baba lacks any sort of direction and feature set. I'm not sure what I want to do with it, but I'm sure I'll build it out eventually.
